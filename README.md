# CineLog

A community film tracking app. Users log films they've watched, rate them, and build collections.

This repository is the starting point for **Project 6: Simulated Code Review**.

---

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

The app starts on `http://localhost:5000` and uses a local SQLite database (`cinelog.db`).

## Data Models

**Film** — A film in the catalog. IDs are UUIDs.

**User** — A registered user. IDs are UUIDs.

**CollectionEntry** — Links a user to a film they've watched. Stores rating and date added. A user can only have one entry per film.

**WatchlistEntry** — Links a user to a film they want to watch later. Stores date added and a `public` flag (defaults to `false` — watchlists are private unless the user explicitly opts in to sharing). A user can only have one entry per film.
